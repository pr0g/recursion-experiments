Insights

1. Always include function parameters and return address in frame object when using an explicit stack
  a. Any state that is 'shared' across a call to a recursive function, needs to be moved to the frame object
2. When passing state down to arguments, do not mutate variable at the current callstack level (that will be changed after the recursive function called returns)
3. When porting a for loop calling a recursive function, the logic at the start of the loop, before the recursive call, needs to happen after the end of the for loop (essentially 'unwrap' the loop)
