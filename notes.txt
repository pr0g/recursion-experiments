// 1. What is the base case? 
// 2. What argument is passed to the recursive function call?
// 3. How does the argument become closer to the base case?

when converting recursive to iterative with explicit stack, only include function parameter (and return_address_e) in the frame_t object
  remove as many local variables as possible to make this clearer (e.g. 'head' with 'head'/'tail' array sum)

Insights

1. When passing state down to arguments, do not mutate variable at the current callstack level (that will be changed after the recursive function called returns)
